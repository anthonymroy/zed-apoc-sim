Simulation of a large outbreak in California, simulated at state resolution.

## Scenario 1 - *Night of the Living Dead (1968)*

Simulation of the original modern zombie movie, *Night of the Living Dead.* The outbreak starts in rural Pennsylvania / Ohio where 0.013% of the population, i.e. the recently deceased, are the original, slow-moving zeds.

## Scenario 2 - *Dawn of the Dead (2004)*

Simulation of the modern, modern zombie movie, the *Dawn of the Dead* remake. This simulation starts with a single patient zero in Milwaukee, WI with a much faster, harder-to-escape zed.

## Scenario 3 - *The Walking Dead (2010)*

This simulation is similar to Scenario 1 except the outbreak starts across the entire Unites States, as the entire population has already been infected.
